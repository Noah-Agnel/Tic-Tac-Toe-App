# Tic-Tac-Toe-App
TacTacToe app for iOS platforms made with Xcode
This was a pretty fun project, which only took me a few days.
The code isn't pretty but the app works quite well and I learned all about Swift and building a UI in Xcode. 
It isn't compatible with ios 17 and above, however copying and pasting the code into xcode 15 beta might work!
